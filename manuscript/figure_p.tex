            (a) projection of full MHC \textit{locus} of eight haploid phased human genome
            assemblies, plus the chm13 cell line and GRCh38 reference genomes, as supplied by the
            Human Reference Pangenome Consortium\citep{HRPC}, created by \cmd{odgi build+sort+viz}. The coloured
            bars represent the linearized paths, representing contigs, as a zoomed out multi-sequence
            alignment. The black lines at the bottom represent the graph topology.
            (b) consensus graph representation of the same assemblies showing variations larger than $100$ base pairs.
            The gene label coordinates were super imposed by using \cmd{odgi position} from GRCh38.
