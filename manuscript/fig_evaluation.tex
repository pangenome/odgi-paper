	\caption{\REVIEWED{Performance on a graph of human chromosome 6 from the HPRC. ODGI compares favorably to VG across all routine pangenomic tasks. Evaluations across threads were done using a 64 human haplotype graph. Evaluations across haplotypes were done using 16 threads. \textbf{(a)} Performance evaluation when translating a graph into the tools' respective native formats. \textbf{(b)} Performance evaluation when extracting the centromeric region from the HPRC graph. \textbf{(c)} Performance evaluation when visualizing a graph. Both tools were run with only one thread. \textit{vg viz}: \textbf{*}A 816MB SVG was produced which can't be opened by any program. \textbf{**}All produced SVGs only contain an XML header, nothing else.}}
