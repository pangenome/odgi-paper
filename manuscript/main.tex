\section{Introduction}

A pangenome models the full set of genomic elements in a given species or clade \citep{Eizenga_2020}.
In contrast to reference-based approaches which relate sequences only to a particular genome, these data structures encode the mutual relationships between all the genomes represented.
A class of methods to represent pangenomes involves the sequence graphs \citep{Paten:2017}, where similar orthologous regions between genomes collapse into a single representative sequence.
In node-labeled sequence graphs, nodes indicate DNA sequences, with edges connecting the nodes that are concatenated in the sequences represented in the graph.
A bidirected sequence graph represents both strands of DNA. On this model, variation graphs add the concept of path to embed linear sequences (e.g., genomes or haplotypes) into the graph.
Paths provide a stable coordinate system, allowing graph annotations and interoperability between different graphs.

Thanks to advances in sequencing technologies, new full-length genome assemblies are produced at a high rate, including efforst from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium\footnote{\url{https://humanpangenome.org/} (accessed Oct 2021)} (HPRC) and Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) projects \citep{Miga:2020, Logsdon_2021, Nurk_2021}, from the T2T consortium\footnote{\url{https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup/home} (accessed Oct 2021)}.
This amount of data offers the opportunity to study genomic variation as never before, but it also brings challenges in how to represent and manipulate hundreds of genomes at a gigabase scale.
Variation graphs compactly represent the full genetic variation across a population, but graph-based data structures present computational overheads: in addition to the sequences, they must also represent the graph topology.
Several genome data structures were developed to address these challenges \citep{Eizenga_2020_BX}.
Here, we build on these approaches, developing essential functions for graph interrogation and manipulation, and refining our implementation to scale to the complexity found in T2T genome assemblies produced with modern long read sequencing. 

%that we have found to be essential during our work in the HPRC.
%Most memory-efficient representations do not allow dynamic updates to the graph, such as adding new genomes or simplifying the graph topology.
%Furthermore, dynamic updates must perform efficiently on the complex graphs generated from whole-genome alignment of vertebrates.
%Highly repetitive regions, such as centromeres, segmental duplications, and acrocentric chromosomes lead to graphs that present paths with very high-depth nodes.
%The node depth is defined as the number of times in which the node is crossed by all the paths embedded in the graph.
%High depth increases the complexity of the operations performed on the paths and the nodes they cross.

%To overcome this limitation, we have developed an 
We implement these functions in the Optimized Dynamic Genome/Graph Implementation (ODGI).
Each tool in ODGI loads graphs into a succinct dynamic HandleGraph model \citep{Eizenga_2020_BX} and applies methods based on the HandleGraph API.
In addition to reusing and extending algorithms shared with the VG toolkit (VG) \citep{Garrison:2018}, we develop new methods to focused specifically on problems encountered when building pangenome graphs at the scale of vertebrate populations.
%However, although similar in scope to VG, ODGI importantly differs in its design to support highly complex pangenome graphs.
To ease interactive use, the majority of the ODGI tools are implemented in an index-free manner, avoiding the need to create index structures at each step of complex graph processing pipelines.
%Indeed, index-constrained implementations would require building indexes also for single or little operations on the graphs.
Thanks to ODGI's efficient path representation, its tools can work with variation graphs with highly complex regions.
This eliminates one of the major bottlenecks when working with very large and deep variation graphs, and allows researchers to build and interrogate graphs of previously-inaccessible complexity and scale.
%efficiently scaling up to hundreds of large vertebrate genomes.

%\begin{methods}

\section{Implementation}

%ODGI is designed to build and modify paths in parallel, keeping its representation in memory efficient.
The ODGI toolkit builds on existing approaches to efficiently store and manipulate variation graphs \citep{Eizenga_2020_BX}. %, presenting a refined and well-tested implementation.
We begin with several key properties which hold for most pangenome variation graphs that we have built: 1) The graphs are relatively sparse, with low node degree; 2) The graphs can be sorted, so that most edges go between nodes that are close together in the sort order (and identifier space); 3) There is high similarity between paths in the graph.
%We incorporate concepts first introduced in the dynamic version of the Graph BWT \citep{Siren:2020} (GBWT), a scalable implementation of the graph extension of the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform \citep{Durbin_2014}.
To exploit these properties, we follow a design first explored in the dynamic Graph BWT (GBWT) \citep{Siren:2020} and build a node-centric model of the graph, where the graph is stored in a vector of node structures, each of which presents a node-local view of the graph sequence, topology, and path layout.
%The identifier of each node is its offset in this vector plus 1.
Each structure contains the sequence of the node, its edges in both directions (forward and backward), and a vector of path steps that describes the previous and next steps in paths that walk across the node.
%Each step records the path identifier and the previous and next path steps on the same path.
As in the GBWT, to compress the encoding, we encode path steps using a local alphabet that maps the N neighbours of the node into the range $1\ldots N$.
To further save space, node deltas, rather than IDs, are stored in this alphabet.
The delta between two nodes is defined as their distance in the graph vector (i.e., the difference between the node offsets).
The path step vector, of length n, is stored using a dynamic succinct integer vector that requires O(5nw) bits, where w is ~log2(N).
Finally, to allow operating on path steps in parallel, each node structure includes a byte-width mutex lock.

%\end{methods}

ODGI is entirely focused on “first-order” operations on the graph (Table 1), providing, unlike VG, no method to construct graphs from raw sequences or map reads.
It supports interrogation of the graph for basic dimensional properties, positional and path-related queries, and visualization in one-dimension (1D) and two-dimensions (2D).
ODGI also supports operations on the graph such as subset, subdivide, break, combine, normalize, or order its components, nodes, and paths.
Most of the tools are designed to be applied together, piping the output of one tool into the next, thereby preventing the creation of intermediate files, and reducing the number of IO operations.

%\subsection{Core functionality}

Variation graphs are commonly represented by a subset of version 1 of the Graphical Fragment Assembly format (GFAv1): odgi build and odgi view allow to convert graphs from GFA to ODGI format and vice versa, respectively.
In the variation graph model, paths have to respect the graph’s topology: this can be verified with odgi validate, to ensure no errors in the input or edited graphs.

By visualizing pangenome graphs, we can gain insight into the relationship between genomes.
odgi viz applies binning and direct rendering to a raster image to generate a 1D representation able to scale up to gigabase pangenome graphs (Figure 1.A).
However, pangenome graphs may present complex structures to visualize: odgi sort finds the best node order to simplify 1D graph visualization by applying several cutting-edge sorting algorithms.
odgi draw extends the visualization in 2D, taking in input the layouts built by odgi layout.

Applying odgi stats, users can retrieve metrics describing the graph properties, such as the number of nodes, edges, paths, and graph length.
ODGI also offers more advanced tools for interrogating the graphs. odgi bin summarizes the path information into bins of specified size, enabling a summarized view of gigabase scale graphs.
odgi depth returns the node depth as defined by query criteria, allowing users to detect the complex regions in the graph due to sequences with highly identical repeats.
Complex motifs can be also detected with odgi degree, which returns the node degree as defined by query criteria.
High degree nodes are the mirror of misassemblies or problems in the pangenome building, making the tool useful for debugging the process as well.

ODGI allows edit operations on the graphs.
Cycles in the graph complicate downstream analyses: odgi break removes the cycles, reducing the complexity of the graph topology.
odgi groom removes spurious inverting links by exploring the graph from the orientation supported by most paths.
To enable efficient sequence alignment against the graph, long nodes can be divided into shorter nodes at a maximum requested size using odgi chop.
Partial order alignment, which consists of aligning sequences against a directed acyclic graph (DAG), is frequently used in pangenome building pipelines, but the current implementations return DAGs with 1-bp long nodes; odgi unchop allows joining nodes that can be merged without changing the graph topology, nor the embedded sequences, obtaining an equivalent, but more compact, representation of the graph.

Pangenome graphs can embed multiple chromosomes as separated connected components (inter-chromosomal structural variants would join the components into bigger ones).
odgi explode separates the connected components in different ODGI format files, while odgi squeeze allows merging multiple graphs into the same ODGI format file, preventing node ID collisions.
odgi extract allows extracting specific subregions of the graph as defined by query criteria, thereby simplifying the downstream analyses and reducing the resources to work only with the extracted region.

In variation graphs the coordinates are provided by the embedded path sequences.
Indeed, the node IDs are not meant to be stable. odgi position finds, translates, and liftovers graph and path positions between different graphs by exploiting their shared path sequences (Figure 1.B).

\subsection{Finding latent structure in the pangenome graph topology}

% simon

% sort / layout / NO tension! We keep that for the sorting paper

% Allows us to understand the sparse structures typically found in pangenome graphs.

Pangenome graphs built from raw sets of alignments may have complex structures which can introduce difficulty in downstream analyses. Uncovering their latent topology allows us to understand their typical sparse structures.

\texttt{odgi sort} offers multiple sorting algorithms to find the best node order in one dimension. Most notably, nodes can be sorted topologically, randomly, by breaking cycles in the graph, by grooming, or by using a novel path-guided stochastic gradient descent (PG-SGD) algorithm. 
The latter one exploits the biological information in the paths for sorting the nodes.
Combining a series of sorts can mitigate the weaknesses of individually applied sorting algorithms. 
In Figure \textbf{\textit{TODO MHC wgg.85}}, a comparison of an unsorted human pangenome MHC graph and a sorted one are displayed.

For the establishment of a layout in two dimensions \texttt{odgi layout} applies a 2D adjusted PG-SGD algorithm. A calculated layout can be visualized statically with \texttt{odgi draw} (see Figure \textit{\textbf{TODO MHC wgg.85}}) or interactively explored with the in-development \texttt{gfaestus}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/chfi/gfaestus}}.

\subsection{Obtaining metrics of the pangenome graph}

% simon
% HTT exon1 
% Only chr8 longs if I can't produce someting nice

% stats / multiQC / bin / degree / depth 

% Solves the problem of understanding the overall structure, size, and features of the graph and its sequences.


Graphs statistics provide alternative ways to gain insight into pangenomes complexity revealing the overall structure, size, and features of a graph and its sequences. 

Applying \texttt{odgi stats}, users can retrieve metrics describing the graph properties, such as the number of nodes, edges, paths, and graph length. 
MultiQC's \citep{Ewels_2016} ODGI module\footnote{\url{https://multiqc.info/docs/\#odgi} (accessed Oct 2021)} provides an interactive way to comparatively explore the statistics of an arbitrary number of graphs. 
ODGI also offers more advanced tools for the interrogation of the graphs. \texttt{odgi bin} summarizes the path information into bins of a specified size, enabling a summarized view of gigabase scale graphs. 
This concept found its way into the pangenome graph ontology \cite{Yokoyama2020}. \texttt{odgi depth} returns the node depth as defined by query criteria, allowing users to assess the complexity of regions in the graph. 
Collapsed sequences with highly identical repeats indicate intricate \textit{loci}. 
Complex motifs can be also detected with \texttt{odgi degree}, which returns the node degree as defined by query criteria. 
High degree nodes can be the mirror of variation, misassemblies, or problems in the pangenome building, making the tool useful for validation. 
In Fig. \ref{fig:metrics}, the characteristics of a 90 haplotypes human pangenome graph of the exon 1 huntingtin gene \citep{Sathasivam2013,Neueder2017} (\textit{HTTexon1}), obtained with the ODGI metrics tools, are shown.

\subsection{Editing the graph structure}

% andrea (?)

% chop / unchop / squeeze / break / prune / explode
These are commonly-needed basic operations on the topology of the graph.

\subsection{Untangling and navigating the pangenome with path-based coordinates}

% erik

% position / tips
% untangle (this follows on the jaccard graph mapping concepts in the previous section}
The graph is a model of an alignment of many genomes.
We can use coordinates in any genome to refer to it, but this requires a few basic operations ...
Obtaining unambiguous mappings between different genomes requires the use of a new kind of graph based mapping (path graph jaccard).

\subsection{Extracting regions of interest}

% andrea (?)

% extract
Pangenome graphs are very large, but we often only want to work with a small portion (e.g. a single gene).
We can extract such regions using coordinates on the paths in the graph to guide us.

\section{Discussion}

% erik & pjotr & anyone

Pangenome graphs stand to become a ubiquitous tool in genomics \citep{Eizenga_2020}. With ODGI we implemented a state-of-the-art tool suite that can transform, analyse, simplify, validate, and visualise pangenome graphs at large scale. Lifting over annotations and linearizing nested graph structures place the suite as the bridge between traditional linear reference genome analysis and pangenome graphs. ODGI is a unique set of tools that enables scientists to explore and discover the underlying biology of pangenome graphs. Already, the tools are the backbone of pipelines such as the Pangenome Graph Builder\footnote{\url{https://github.com/pangenome/pggb} (accessed Oct 2021)} (PGGB) or nf-core/pangenome\footnote{\url{https://github.com/nf-core/pangenome} (accessed Oct 2021)}. Future work will add support for RNA and protein sequences and expand on metadata capabilities of large pangenome graphs.

rdf sparql side, bring in annotation for great biological interpretation \cite{Yokoyama2020}, federated queries, sharing, FAIR

(recent) interactive visualization tools?! CITE PANACHE, also indicate that no published tool for interactive exploration of such graphs exist
